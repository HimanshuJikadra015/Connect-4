# Connect Four using Min-Max Algorithm

Play the Connect Four game against AI opponents using the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The discs fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent does.

In this project, I've implemented the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to create AI opponents that can strategically plan their moves, making the gameplay more challenging and engaging. Three different heuristic functions are used to evaluate game states, allowing the AI to make intelligent decisions.

## Features

- Choose from various gameplay modes: Human vs. Human, Human vs. AI, AI vs. AI.
